							<h1>Code of Conduct</h1><p>
				The goal of this Code of Conduct is to ensure that every participant of the Hechtstechen Diplomacy tournament has a pleasant time and feels safe and comfortable while attending the event. The Code of Conduct is to be respected at all times during the tournament and the activities which are offered along with it.<p>
				We recognize that Diplomacy is an emotional game. Tensions may run high and betrayal may happen. Nevertheless, there exist some norms of behavior that must be respected at all times, on and off boards. At all times for the entire duration of the tournament, whether during games or not, every participant must:<p>
				1. Treat everyone with respect, regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, age, or any other category of personal identity;<p>
    			2. Refrain from discriminating against other participants on the grounds of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion age, or any other category of personal identity;<p>
    			3. Refrain from behavior that disturbs the ability of other participants to enjoy themselves or that disrupts activities unrelated to the competition. This includes but is not limited to verbal abuse, threats of violence, unwanted physical contact, and any form of sexual harassment or unwelcome sexual attention;<p>
    			4. Make good faith efforts to support the safety of other participants, the community as a whole, and to follow the rules.<p>
    			Players are encouraged to report any believed violations of the above provisions to the Tournament Director or a designated representative. All communications will be handled confidentially. The Tournament Director or their representative will mediate in good faith and take whatever action they deem appropriate to resolve the situation.
    			<p>
				Diplomacy often involves some level of on-board player contest. Players are free to choose who they do or do not work with for any reason - however this should always be done in line with above provisions, and must not be on the grounds of an individual's identity in any way. Choose your allies based on how they play, not who they are.<p>
				Any attempt to abuse the Code of Conduct in order to gain advantage in any competition will be considered a violation and should be referred to the Tournament Director or their representative for review.
